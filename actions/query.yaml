  query:
    type: string
    description: >
      Query string in InfluxQL syntax:
      https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/query_language/
  chunked:
    type: integer
    description: >
      Returns points in streamed batches instead of in a single response.
      If set to a specific value, InfluxDB chunks responses by series or by that number
      of points.
    default: 0
  database:
    type: string
    description: >
      Sets the target database for the query.
      Required for database-dependent queries (most SELECT queries and SHOW queries
      require this parameter).
  epoch:
    type: string
    description: >
      Returns epoch timestamps with the specified precision [ns,u,ms,s,m,h].
      By default, InfluxDB returns timestamps in RFC3339 format with nanosecond precision.
  method:
    type: string
    description: >
      Name of HTTP method to use for the call.
       GET - Use for all queries that start with: SELECT, SHOW
             The only exceptions are SELECT queries that include an INTO clause.
             Those SELECT queries require a POST request.
       POST - Use for all queries taht start with: ALTER, CREATE, DELETE, DROP, GRANT, KILL, REVOKE
       
      Note: We try to auto-detect this by checking the <query> parameter using .startswith().
            Since this is not always perfect, we allow the user to override and specify their
            own method.
